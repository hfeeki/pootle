Directory contents
-------------------
+ js/

  - admin.js :
    Code for tasks performed in the administration area.

    Also sorts select elements (both normal and multiple) where language names are
    involved. This is done in JavaScript because currently it's not possible
    to sort them within Django.
    To sort a new select element, add the end of the element id to the 'ids'
    array.

  - common.js :
    Common code that is included in every page. This includes:
    - Code to handle the page zoom feature.
    - Code to handle the advanced search dropdown. May be merged with other code
    in the translate page.

  - correctpng.js :
    Fixes for IE 5.5 & 6 to correctly handle PNG transparencies.

  - diff_match_patch.js :
    Google's Diff, Match, and Patch libraries for plain text.
    It's used for suggestion's diff highlighting.

    https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/

  - editor.js :
    Code that sets up the editor and handles all the actions involved there.
    This includes unit navigation, submission, suggestions' handling, copying
    functions, fuzzy/unfuzzy, and several other helper stuff.

  - json2.min.js :
    JavaScript library for encoding/decoding data to/from JSON format.

  - shortcut.js :
    Small library to ease adding keyboard shortcuts.

    http://www.openjs.com/scripts/events/keyboard_shortcuts/

  - sorttable.js :
    Sorts tables according to its values. Used in the homepage as well as on the
    languages and projects listings. It has some customisations to support
    zebra stripes once the sort is done (using jQuery). The icons used on the
    table headings are custom code too.
    We may want to use a table sorter purely written in jQuery, such as
    tablesorter (http://tablesorter.com/docs/).

    - jquery.jsonp.js :
      Alternative solution to jQuery's JSONP support.

      jQuery's JSONP support has some limitations (it can't handle error
      callbacks, doesn't have an abort method, ...), and this plugin
      tries to address those issues.

      These features may be implemented in jQuery core at some stage.

      Using version 2.1.4.

      https://code.google.com/p/jquery-jsonp/

    - jquery.serializeObject.js :
      A method for serializing forms directly into objects.

      Whereas jQueryâ€™s built-in .serializeArray() method serializes a form
      into an array, .serializeObject() serializes a form into an
      (arguably more useful) object.
